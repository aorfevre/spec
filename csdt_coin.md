### Project Name

Xar Network

### Coin Name

CSDT (Collateralized Stable Debt Tokens)

### Official website

[Xar Network](https://xar.network)

### Elevator Pitch(s)

- Non-Inflationary, Stable, Sustainable Proof Of Stake
- The framework for Cosmos and Fantom-based decentralized finance.
- Decentralized, Stable, Unbiased currency that offers stable rewards

## Project Overview

[DeFi Chain Modules](https://xar.network/docs/xar-defi-chain-modules.pdf)

### Pain-points addressed by CSDT

CSDT is a non-inflationary, stable reward, sustainable Proof-Of-Stake solution, that provides greater yield for stakers (via consolidated DEFI) and lower interest rates and fees for borrowers and traders (via consolidated liquidity).

Stakers provide collateral to the coinswap, DEX, synthetic, and loan modules, and receive consolidated rewards from all modules. Collateral is consolidated in a collateral pool and each module borrows from this pool and pays interest rates and fees. This optimized collateral provides lower fees and interest rates for borrowers.

(For the Staker/Validator) Consolidated fees for higher DeFi rewards
(For the borrower/trader) Lower interest rates/fees because of consolidated liquidity
(For chain security) Shared security between DeFi and Staking

From an economics perspective;

Non inflationary, stable rewards

For better Opex and reward management from a coin that won't devalue because of Inflationary supply

### Supported Collateral

- FTM

### Planned support*

- BNB
- BTC
- ETH

*Community dependent

### Target Demographic (High Level)

- Retail investors on the DeFi side
- Central and corporate banks on the FinTech side

## Describe the Project

Xar Network was created from a need of corporate and central banks to use blockchain technology in a private, permissioned space. As our feature set grew we noticed consistent cross-over with the decentralized finance ecosystem, so eventually the Xar toolkit grew to a full-fledged decentralized finance toolbox. Xar Network offers access to advantages of both purely traditional banking systems and blockchain systems - using blockchain based or decentralized finance (DeFi).

### Long term vision

Grow on-chain AUM to ~$100MM, accomplishing this via competitive interest rates and higher APR yield. Stakers provide liquidity and security. We are also working with multiple Central and Corporate bank projects in 3 different geographic regions.

### CSDT use cases

- Stable Staking / Delegating ~ Network Security
- Transaction fees (0.0025ucsdt / tx)
- Rebalancing fee (default 30% of debt raised)
- Auctions (default 0.0025% Maker/Taker)
- Dex (default 0.0025% Maker/Taker)
- Synths (default ~0.0025% - 3% Long/Short)
- Coinswap (default ~0.0025 - 3%) per trade
- Lending (Utilization % formulate to get interest fee)
- Stable payments

### Necessity of a new native coin

Premined tokens can't be used as they break the economics of stable, sustainable, non-inflationary staking. This rules out all current existing tokens. But we also did not want to do an ICO, or raise any funds, and so we incorporated popular and existing cryptocurrencies to provide them additional value and utility.

### Project Competitors

Crypto: MakerDAO, Uniswap, Compound, Synthetixs

While the following is an inaccurate analogy, we find it is an effective way to explain the difference. With ETH moving to proof of stake, CSDT is equivalent to Staking ETH, this ETH is made available as liquidity to MakerDAO, Uniswap, Compound and Synthetixs. Sharing liquidity and security, while additionally providing you rewards from tx fees, DAI DSR, Compound interest rates, Uniswap trade fees, and Synthetix trade fees. This consolidated DeFi solution built as a layer 1 instead of a DAPP, allows for lower interest rates for borrowers, with higher yield for stakers / liquidity providers, while sharing on-chain security with DeFi liquidity.

Non-crypto: R3, Hyperledger

Our suite has been built from the last 12 month journey we have had with multiple corporate and 1 central bank. The toolset is built around usability and ease-of-use, with existing solutions like R3, and Hyperleder, these tools and ecosystem components must still be built, we provide them pre-packaged, with regulatory compliance, and even licensing for CSDT as an investment vehicle.
